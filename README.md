# effsize
R effsize package for efficient effect size computation.

This package contains the functions to compute the standardized 
effect sizes for experiments 
(Cohen d, Hedges g, Cliff delta, Vargha and Delaney A). 

The computation algorithms have been optimized to allow efficient 
computation even with very large data sets.

The package is available on the CRAN web site: 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/effsize/index.html
